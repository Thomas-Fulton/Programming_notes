Notes on the basics and best practices for programming languages, various software, and more general linux-based programming principles eg. use of: python, R, BASH, Git, Vim, Docker containers, HPC clusters etc. Notes created here to help while learning and as record key points and basics as reminders.  

Reminder: look at other __projects__ for more detailed and complete examples of R and python, eg. python-card-games for use of python classes/OOP and package/module structure, MSc and Research Assistant position project  (Ludwig_2019/mutation_plot_script.R) for ggplot2 and data manipulation in R (Ludwig_2019/mutation_plot_script.R), etc.
