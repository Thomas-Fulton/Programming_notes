## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Two new lines must be used to make a new line in the knitted document. Two returns must be made for a new line.

* A list is created with the \* or an ordered list is created with 1. (item)
  + indented list is made with two spaces a followed by \+
    + further indented
* Text between \` and \` shows `content` as r code.
* Text between \* and \* shows *content* in italics
* Text between \** and \** shows **content** in bold
* A header is created by prefixing it with \#. The more the smaller the font.

A table is created as follows (doesn't always work dunno why)

Table Header | Second Header
------------- | -------------
Table Cell | Cell 2
Cell 3 | Cell 4 


### Cell Parameters

`echo = FALSE` prevents R code that generated output from being printed

`result = "hide"` prevents output of r code from being printed.

`include = FALSE` parameter prevents r code or output being shown on knitted document





```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
