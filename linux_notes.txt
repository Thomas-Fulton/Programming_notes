   ###  File System Hierarchy  ###
/usr/
  # unix system resources - don't change
 /usr/local/
  # The /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated.
  /usr/local/bin/
  /usr/local/lib/
  /usr/local/share/
  # most programs are installed here: not affected by a system software update like files in /usr/
  # similar to the root directory structure
  # becomes messy quickly: the system can identify what file is used by what program but it is not human friendly. Therefore, additional software can be install to /opt/ instead.
/opt/  
  # for add-on packages and software, and can be much more human readable.
  # new directory for each software/program
  # create dirs here to install your own programs (then either create symlink from opt/dir to local/bin, or add opt/dir/bin $PATH)

   ###  Installing programs  ###
  ##  Apt  ##


  ##  Manual installation  ##
# https://itsfoss.com/install-software-from-source-code/
# Follow the FSH (File system hierarchy)

# When in doubt, make a directory /opt/program_name, and install to there:
mkdir /opt/myprog-1.0
git clone myprog-1.0.git
cd /opt/myprog-1.0
./configure --prefix=/opt/myprog-1.0

# Now your program can be ran using the full path:
/opt/myprog-1.0/bin/myprog-1.0

# To run the program more easily by just typing the name either: add to $PATH, or make a symlink to eg.local/bin.
# Export to $PATH: 
export PATH=/opt/myprog-1.0/bin:$PATH 
# Create symlink:
ln -s my_prog-1.0/bin/executable /usr/local/bin/
