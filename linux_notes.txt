   ###  File System Hierarchy  ###
/usr/
  # unix system resources - don't change
 /usr/local/
  # The /usr/local hierarchy is for use by the system administrator when installing software locally. It needs to be safe from being overwritten when the system software is updated.
  /usr/local/bin/
  /usr/local/lib/
  /usr/local/share/
  # most programs are installed here: not affected by a system software update like files in /usr/
  # similar to the root directory structure
  # becomes messy quickly: the system can identify what file is used by what program but it is not human friendly. Therefore, additional software can be install to /opt/ instead.
/opt/  
  # for add-on packages and software, and can be much more human readable.
  # new directory for each software/program
  # create dirs here to install your own programs (then either create symlink from opt/dir to local/bin, or add opt/dir/bin $PATH)
/etc/
  # mostly configuration files of programs

   ###  Installing programs  ###
  ##  Apt  ##
  # Repositories # 
# see: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories
# Stored/accessed in the file "/etc/apt/sources.list", and additionally in the directory "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/"
# These are in the format:
     deb [website] [release][-channel] [component]
e.g.
     deb http://se.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jammy-updates main
# Components include: 
# - main
# - restricted 
# - universe
# - multiverse

# Channels include for OS release "jammy":
# - jammy: Don’t touch it, I like consistency, even with my unresolved bugs. 
# - jammy-security: I accept patches to existing versions (and very rare version upgrades if absolutely necessary) in the process of keeping my system secure.
# - jammy-updates: some bugs are worth fixing, and I trust you enough to install these on my system, but probably not in broader production deployments.

# TODO deb vs deb-src



  ##  Manual installation  ##
# https://itsfoss.com/install-software-from-source-code/
# Follow the FSH (File system hierarchy)

# When in doubt, make a directory /opt/program_name, and install to there:
mkdir /opt/myprog-1.0
git clone myprog-1.0.git
cd /opt/myprog-1.0
./configure --prefix=/opt/myprog-1.0

# Now your program can be ran using the full path:
/opt/myprog-1.0/bin/myprog-1.0

# To run the program more easily by just typing the name either: add to $PATH, or make a symlink to eg.local/bin.
# Export to $PATH: 
export PATH=/opt/myprog-1.0/bin:$PATH 
# Create symlink:
ln -s full/path/to/my_prog-1.0/bin/executable /usr/local/bin/
ln -s /opt/my_prog-1.0/bin/executable /home/wfulton/bin/

# Put following into custom command in profile:
sh -c 'cd ~ ;caffeine-indicator'
